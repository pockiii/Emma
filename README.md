Initial design (made with Figma): https://dribbble.com/shots/23657062-Design-Challenge

## Features 
Final implementation includes 2 pages; a contacts page and a profile page. 
The contacts page can be scrolled through vertically, or you can scroll to the user by tapping on their picture on the horizontal menu. 
The profile page is static, but demonstrates navigation through the app.
Design includes a bottom navigation bar which is static in this iteration as the scope doesn't allow for any utilization of a navigation bar.

## Running 
Project runs in Android and iOS with 
```
npx react-native run-android
```
or
```
npm run ios
```

## Testing 
tbd

## Notes
Tried my best to make all elements modular, may have ran out of time to clean up some code.
